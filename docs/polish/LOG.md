## WU-000 · Phase 0 baseline (2026-08-12)

**Hypothesis.** None — Phase 0 is measurement, not change. Goal: establish
`MAP.md`, `BASELINE.md`, a starting scorecard, and a deterministic capture
harness, then stop without fixing anything.

**Change.** No gameplay, simulation, or rendering code was modified. Added
`scripts/capture.mjs` (capture infrastructure), `CLAUDE.md`, and `docs/polish/`.
`package.json` and `package-lock.json` are deliberately untouched — the
playwright dependency needed for capture was installed with `--no-save` rather
than committed, because committing it requires first fixing the broken lockfile
(P0-1), which is a change and therefore out of Phase 0 scope.

**Findings.**
- 28 test files / 94 tests pass. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
- `npm install` fails on a clean clone — corrupt `package-lock.json` entry
  (P0-1).
- ~~**The WebGPU render path produces a black screen on Chromium 141.**~~
  **[RETRACTED — see WU-000b below. This was a harness artifact, not a defect.]**
  three 0.185.1 passes `swizzle: 'rgba'` (string) where current Chromium requires a
  `GPUTextureComponentSwizzle` dictionary; every `GPUTexture.createView()`
  throws (P0-2). Confirmed by capture, not by code reading: all nine WebGPU
  frames are pure black while the FPS counter still reads "WebGPU · 60 fps".
- ~~Forcing the WebGL2 fallback renders the identical scene cleanly, which
  isolates the fault to the WebGPU path.~~ **[RETRACTED — this only ruled out a
  WebGL2 explanation, never the flag-induced one that was actually responsible.]**
  It does remain the usable evidence route in a GPU-less environment.
- The empty `herd` capture was initially mis-recorded as a rendering defect.
  Corrected on owner input: grazers arrive only via Distant Drifter and must
  survive a further jump, so their absence is correct. The real finding is an
  evidence-harness gap (P1-1) — no capture can currently contain fauna.

**Verdict.** Baseline established, but **provisional**. Every visual score was
taken on the WebGL2 fallback, which THESIS §6 explicitly rules out as a target,
so scores must be re-taken on WebGPU after P0-2 clears. No trustworthy
performance number exists from this environment (see `DEFERRED.md`).

**Next.** WU-001 = P0-1 (lockfile). It is nearly free and unblocks committing
the capture dependency.

## WU-000b · Correction: P0-2 retracted (2026-08-12)

**What went wrong.** Phase 0 filed a P0 claiming the WebGPU path renders a black
screen on Chromium 141+, based on nine black captures and a `createView`
type error on `swizzle`. The owner reported WebGPU works locally on the pushed
commit, which prompted a retest.

**Root cause of the false finding.** `scripts/capture.mjs` passed
`--enable-unsafe-webgpu`. That flag exposes experimental WebGPU IDL members that
shipping browsers do not. WebIDL silently ignores unknown dictionary members, so
three 0.185.1's incorrect `swizzle = 'rgba'` is inert in a real browser and only
becomes a hard type error once the flag turns the member on. Re-running capture
without the flag showed this sandbox exposes **no WebGPU adapter at all** and
falls back to WebGL2 — so the shipping path was never testable here, and the
"verified not a sandbox artifact" claim in the original entry was unfounded: it
only ruled out a *WebGL2* explanation, not a flag-induced one.

**Change.** `--enable-unsafe-webgpu` is now opt-in (`--unsafe-webgpu`, default
off). P0-2 marked WITHDRAWN with the reasoning retained so it is not re-filed.
Stability rescored 3 → 7 and Polish 3 → 5, both of which had been marked down
for the imaginary black screen; assessed mean 4.1 → 4.6. `CLAUDE.md` now carries
a standing rule: never conclude the renderer is broken from a headless capture.

**Lesson worth keeping.** A capture harness that "succeeds" can still be
measuring a configuration no player has. Flags that force a feature into
existence change what is being tested.
